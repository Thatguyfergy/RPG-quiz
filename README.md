# Just a simple project I made involving HTML, CSS and Javascript.  

 I always wanted to try and make my own tabletop RPG for my friends and for the most part, tabletop RPGs can be played virtually. 

 However, character creation, particularly when it came to stats, often proved to be quite complex. So my goal was to make an easy to understand pseudo personality test to determine 4 key skills each character needs in the game and how it affects gameplay accordingly.  

 The actual RPG and it's rules aren't included here but the quiz is.
